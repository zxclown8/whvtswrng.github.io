    <h1>Shadow Fiend</h1>
    <img src="img/Shadowfiend.jpg" alt="Error: picture not loaded">
    <p>It is said that Nevermore the Shadow Fiend has the soul of a poet, and in fact he has thousands of them. Over the ages he has claimed the souls of poets, priests, emperors, beggars, slaves, philosophers, criminals and (naturally) heroes; no sort of soul escapes him. What he does with them is unknown. No one has ever peered into the Abysm whence Nevermore reaches out like an eel from among astral rocks. Does he devour them one after another? Does he mount them along the halls of an eldritch temple, or pickle the souls in necromantic brine? Is he merely a puppet, pushed through the dimensional rift by a demonic puppeteer? Such is his evil, so intense his aura of darkness, that no rational mind may penetrate it. Of course, if you really want to know where the stolen souls go, there's one sure way to find out: Add your soul to his collection. Or just wait for Nevermore.</p>

    <h3>Requiem of souls</h3>
    <span>
        Shadow Fiend gathers his captured souls to release them as lines of demonic energy. Units near Shadow Fiend when the souls are released can be damaged by several lines of energy. Any unit damaged by Requiem of Souls will be feared and have its movement speed and magic resistance reduced for 0.7 seconds for each line hit up to a maximum of 2.15. Lines of energy are created for every soul captured through Necromastery.
        </span>
        <div>Requiem of Souls is automatically cast whenever Shadow Fiend dies, regardless of its cooldown.</div>
